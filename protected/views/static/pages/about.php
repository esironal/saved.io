<h3>About</h3>
<p>Everyday I use many different devices - my iphone, macbook, ipad, Windows machine etc.  I also use a number of different browsers -  Safari on iOS and Firefox and Chrome on OSx and Windows. </p>
<p>This means that I was often losing bookmarks or simply not saving them because there was no easy way to do it across devices.  I didn't want to install extensions (which slow down the browsers and can introduce security issues) and it's not even possible on many devices.</p>
<p>To solve this problem I built <?php echo Yii::app()->name ?>.  I came up with a solution that is super fast and easy to use, requires no extensions, and is future proof - it will work in any browser.  I've been running a version of the app locally for over a year, but I thought others may find it useful so I've released it to the world.  <?php echo Yii::app()->name ?> is free to use</p>
<p><?php echo Yii::app()->name ?> is ridiculously simple to use - just type "<?php echo Utils::getBaseUrl() ?>/" in front of any URL in your address bar, hit enter and you've just saved a bookmark.  I've purposefully left out Tags, Folders, Descriptions, Notes etc. from this app.  Saving a bookmark should be fast.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using <?php echo Yii::app()->name ?> as much as I have enjoyed building it.</p>
